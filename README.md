# Quiz-Management-system
The ONGC Quiz Management App System is a web application built using React and PHP that serves as a comprehensive solution for managing and conducting quizzes within the ONGC organization. This system is divided into three main folders: "ongc," "login-system," and "cra." The "ongc" folder contains the PHP application for ONGC admin users to manage the quiz database, including creating, updating, and deleting questions. The "login-system" folder houses the PHP application responsible for user authentication and authorization. Once authenticated, users can access the quiz page in the "cra" folder, which is implemented in React. The React app fetches questions from the SQL database managed by ONGC admin and provides a user-friendly interface for answering quiz questions. The system also offers functionality to display quiz results, sorted by quiz attempts, for authorized users, viewable exclusively by admin users. Admin users have the ability to publish results as needed.
